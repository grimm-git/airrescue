# Air Rescue
This is a game written in MMBasic for the Color Maximite 2 (CMM2)

The goal of the game is to rescue people from an hostile environment.
The enemy will try everything to stop you. But be carefull in combat
not to kill your people by friendly fire.

The Colour Maximite 2 is a small self contained computer inspired by
the home computers of the early 80's such as the Tandy TRS-80,
Commodore 64 and Apple II. (https://geoffg.net/maximite.html)
