# Air Rescue
This is a game written in MMBasic for the Color Maximite 2 (CMM2)

The goal of the game is to rescue people from an hostile environment.
The enemy will try everything to stop you. But be careful in combat
not to kill your people with friendly fire.

This game was inspired by the old classic 'Choplifter' from the C64
or Atari. It has been redeveloped from scratch including graphics,
sound effects and game mechanics.

The game can be played with a Nunchuk or with the keyboard
	    Nunchuk	Keyboard
Controls    joystick	cursor keys
Fire	    Button z	Key 'a'

To change the orientation of the helicopter move the joystick in the
desired direction and press fire button for 1-2 seconds. This way you
can fly backwards or turn the helicopter.

To board people just land close to them. After landing they will
start running towards the helicopter.

Each rescued human is rewarded with 100 credits but for each killed
human you have to pay 500 credits for compensation. So, do your best
to protect the people.

The Colour Maximite 2 is a small self contained computer inspired by
the home computers of the early 80's such as the Tandy TRS-80,
Commodore 64 and Apple II. (https://geoffg.net/maximite.html)
